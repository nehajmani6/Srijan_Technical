* The cryto libraries being used should follow a standard interface and should be easily pluggable in the encryption client. (Read how provider design pattern works) https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms972319.aspx
* Provide a factory to create instances of crypto libraries. http://www.phptherightway.com/pages/Design-Patterns.html
* Add relevant unit test cases
* Language Preferred: PHP
* Should follow PSR4 autoloading
